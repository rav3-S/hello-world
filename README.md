hey there!

I once came across a qoute that goes like " I see now that the circumstances of one's birth are irrelevant,
                                             It is what you do with the gift of life that determines who you are"
                                             
 Ghandi didnt say this.Martin Luther King didnt say this.Jesus Christ didnt say this.MotherFrikkin MEWTWO from Pokemon said this
